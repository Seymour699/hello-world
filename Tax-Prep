each month, if you have a checking account, you receive a statement from your financial institution. upon receipt of the statement, 
you are encouraged to balance your account with the financial's statement. what you have in the month's transaction as your check 
register often bears little resemblance to the statement thanks to payees not depositing/cashing your checks within the time
framework of the calendar month. this is a spreadsheet of the actual status of your checking accountwith allocations for end of
year tax itemizing. the spreadsheet form is in an Open Office format.
